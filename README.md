# WebBoard
I'm extending the work of a class project to become my own thing, with added features and fixes.

This project was originally was called LTUBillboard and was a group project with some classmates. 
The end project was not really what I wanted it to be, so I'm going to work on fixing stuff that is broken and add features. 
One big thing that was pointed out during presentation was that it wasn't so much a billboard replacement as much as just a web calendar.

This is my first major project when it comes to web development, so I'm still learning a lot.

# WebBoard
I'm extending the work of a class project to become my own thing, with added features and fixes.

This project was originally was called LTUBillboard and was a group project with some classmates. 
The end project was not really what I wanted it to be, so I'm going to work on fixing stuff that is broken and add features. 
One big thing that was pointed out during presentation was that it wasn't so much a billboard replacement as much as just a web calendar.

This is my first major project when it comes to web development, so I'm still learning a lot.

The goal of this site is to be an upgrade for the billboards that most schools have around their campuses. Those billboards can be good sources of information, but it can be work to keep those updated and they might not be updated. Also there is the waste of paper, and the fact that you can only know about that information when you're looking at it unless you write it down or take a picture of it. This site is used as a type of web application that can be viewed on a computer or mobile browser.

I also want to modify it a little bit to be used in my house as a calendar on a monitor we have in our kitchen. I'm going to use a raspberry pie that hosts a webserver where the members of my family can set up events that they are doing so everyone knows what is going on. I also want to create an actual mobile app that can be used to update the calendar, because even though it's not needed or efficient, it can be good to learn.
